The cat sat on the mat
The dog ate my homework
I will go to the beach tomorrow
The sun is shining today
The sky is blue
I love eating pizza
The movie was great
I am going to the gym
The book was interesting
I am learning how to code
The weather is nice today
I am going to the park
The car is red
I am drinking coffee right now
The music is loud
I am watching TV
The phone is ringing
I am listening to music
The food was delicious
I am going to the store
